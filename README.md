## Overview

The Stone-Paper-Scissor game with AI is an interactive game built using Python with TensorFlow, OpenCV (cv2), Mediapipe, Tkinter, and an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach. The game allows users to play against an AI opponent in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Interaction**: Engage in a Stone-Paper-Scissor game with the AI in real-time.
- **AI Opponent**: Utilizes TensorFlow for AI-powered decision-making.
- **Computer Vision (CV2)**: Integrates OpenCV and Mediapipe for real-time hand gesture recognition.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Tkinter for a simple and visually appealing user experience.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Approach**: Ensures a modular and organized codebase.

## Repository Structure

- `/src`: Contains the source code for the game.
  - `/modules`: Modules and classes for different components of the game.
- `/screenshots`: Screenshots of the game in action.
- `/models`: Saved AI model for hand gesture recognition.
- `/tests`: Unit tests for ensuring the functionality of the code.

## How to Play
